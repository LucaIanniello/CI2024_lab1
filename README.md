# Set Cover Exercise

This repository contains the solution to the Set Cover problem implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `set-cover-best.ipynb` by the student Luca Ianniello, s327313.

## Algorithm Description

### Initialization
The algorithm begins by generating an initial random solution, where each set is either included or excluded based on a random threshold (in this case, `1`, meaning all sets are initially included).

### Fitness Function
The fitness of a solution is evaluated using two criteria:
1. **Validity:** Checks whether the current solution covers all elements in the universe.
2. **Cost:** Computes the total cost of the sets included in the solution. The cost is minimized, with lower values indicating better solutions.

### Mutation Strategy
The algorithm employs a mutation strategy to explore neighboring solutions:
- **Multiple Mutation Strength:** A proportion of sets is randomly flipped (included or excluded) based on a defined strength parameter. The strength is adjusted dynamically based on the coverage achieved by the new solution compared to the previous one.

### Iterative Improvement
The algorithm iteratively refines the solution over a specified number of steps (`1,000` in this implementation):
- In each iteration:
  - The coverage of the current solution is counted.
  - A new solution is generated by mutating the current one.
  - The fitness of the new solution is evaluated.
  - If the new solution improves upon the current one (i.e., has a higher fitness), it replaces the current solution.
  - The mutation strength is adjusted based on the change in coverage.

### Logging and Visualization
- The algorithm logs the cost of the solutions over iterations, allowing for visualization of the optimization process. The plot shows the history of the best costs encountered throughout the iterations.

### Output
The algorithm outputs:
- The final fitness of the best solution found.
- The number of steps taken to reach this solution.
